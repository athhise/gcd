Welcome to this assignment part of the Data specialization courses.

You are provided with the following files:

- README.md which tells you how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

- CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

- run_analysis.R which performs the assignment as requested. Its output is a tidy data frame which will  be saved in your current working directory.


You are requested to have installed the **"dplyr"** package in order to run the R script properly. 
Please set your working directory to the directory where you have extracted the data. You might want to use the function: **getwd()** to know your current working directory and **setwd()** to set your working directory. 

The  assignement asked to do the following:

        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
        variable for each activity and each subject.

In the R script you will notice that as the order of doing the work is not an obligation, we did the steps 3 and 4 before doing the step 2. We think that this is a more suitable way to match the variables names and then extract the measurements we are interested in.  



Thank you very much for taking from your precious time to evaluate this work.
Please apologize in advance when you find any mistake in the construction of the sentences (I am not a english native).

Good luck in your experience with coursera.

The Author.
